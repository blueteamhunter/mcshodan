üßæ AWS Route 53 DNS Audit ‚Äì Automated Reporting Architecture

Epic: Cloud Compliance & Governance
Component: AWS Automation / Lambda / S3 / SNS
Owner: DevOps Team
Status: ‚úÖ Operational

üß© Summary

This architecture automates the monthly export of Route 53 DNS zones and records from two AWS member accounts into a centralized S3 bucket, generating a master CSV report, and notifying stakeholders via SNS email.

All operations run serverlessly (Lambda) and respect least-privilege cross-account IAM roles.
The process avoids any persistent compute cost and runs on demand or via a scheduled EventBridge rule.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Main Components

Component	Purpose
AWS Lambda (Audit Function)	Central function that assumes cross-account roles, exports Route 53 hosted zones and records, consolidates data, and sends SNS email notification.
AWS Organizations	Provides account management context (optional). In this deployment, the Lambda is locked to two specific accounts (B & C).
Cross-Account IAM Role (OrgRoute53ReadRole)	Deployed in member accounts (B & C). Grants minimal permissions to list Route 53 zones and records.
Central S3 Bucket	Stores per-account CSVs and a consolidated ALL.csv master report.
SNS Topic	Sends an email notification containing a summary and the presigned S3 URL for download.
EventBridge Rule (optional)	Triggers the Lambda on the 1st of each month to automate reporting.
üß† Data Flow

Lambda Execution
The main Lambda (route53-monthly-export) is manually invoked or triggered by schedule.

Account Targeting
The function uses the environment variable ALLOWED_ACCOUNT_IDS (comma-separated) to define which member accounts to query.
It never calls organizations:ListAccounts unless explicitly allowed.

Cross-Account Role Assumption
For each target account:

Lambda assumes arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/OrgRoute53ReadRole

That role has route53:ListHostedZones and route53:ListResourceRecordSets permissions.

Data Collection
Each account‚Äôs hosted zones and records are retrieved via AWS SDK (boto3).
Data is written to memory and serialized as CSV:

route53_<account_name>_<account_id>.csv


Master Consolidation
All rows are merged into a single file:

route53/monthly/<yyyy-mm-dd>/ALL.csv


S3 Storage
CSVs are uploaded to a secure private S3 bucket (org-dns-reports-<account>).
Bucket access is limited to the Lambda execution role and security administrators.

Notification & Distribution
Lambda generates a presigned S3 URL (valid 7 days) and publishes a message to an SNS topic.
The message includes:

Summary of zones and record counts per account

The download URL enclosed in angle brackets for better formatting

Email Delivery
SNS sends plain-text emails to subscribed recipients.
(Note: Outlook Safe Links may rewrite URLs; customers can whitelist the sender or domain.)

üîê Security Model
Layer	Control	Description
Lambda IAM Role	Scoped to minimum S3/SNS/STS permissions	Can only AssumeRole into specific account ARNs and access the report bucket.
Member Account Role (OrgRoute53ReadRole)	Scoped read-only	Allows only DNS listing actions, denies modifications.
S3 Bucket Policy	Private	No public access; presigned URLs expire automatically.
SNS Topic	Internal	Used for notification only, no external subscriptions.
Data Sensitivity	Low	Contains DNS record metadata (no PII).
‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Variables
Variable	Example	Description
ORG_ROLE_NAME	OrgRoute53ReadRole	Role name to assume in target accounts
REPORT_BUCKET	org-dns-reports-123456789012	Centralized private S3 bucket
REPORT_PREFIX	route53/monthly/	Folder prefix for reports
SNS_TOPIC_ARN	arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:route53-monthly-dns-report	SNS topic for notifications
PRESIGN_TTL_SEC	604800	Presigned URL expiration (seconds)
ALLOWED_ACCOUNT_IDS	111111111111,222222222222	Explicit account allowlist
FORCE_ALLOWED_ONLY	true	Prevents fallback to Organization listing

üßÆ Cost & Maintenance

Lambda	< 1M invocations/month	‚âà $0.00 (free tier)

SNS	Few messages/month	Negligible
CloudWatch Logs	Execution logs	< $1/month

üß± Deployment Steps (Summary)

Create central S3 bucket

Create SNS topic and email subscription

Deploy OrgRoute53ReadRole to target accounts (B & C)

Deploy Lambda function route53-monthly-export

Configure environment variables & IAM policy

Test invocation (aws lambda invoke ...)

(Optional) Add EventBridge rule for monthly schedule

üß© Known Limitations

Presigned URL rewriting: Outlook Safe Links may corrupt links ‚Äî customers can whitelist or request an alternate delivery mechanism (SES, API Gateway redirect, etc.)

IAM dependency: Role name OrgRoute53ReadRole must exist in all target accounts.

Execution time: Large Route 53 datasets may require increasing Lambda timeout (default 900 s).

Single region: Reports assume Route 53 is global (no regional separation).

‚úÖ Validation Checklist
Item	Status	Notes
